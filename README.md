# Dynamic-Dropdowns

<p>I created dynamic dropdown lists for use in automotive ecommerce sites. The program creates a query string that sends the user to the correct page within our existing site and can be modified to work within your site with a few edits. I had to find a way to create this entirely on the front end because it is being used on a Squarespace site, but it is a great solution for anybody that is not interested in using PHP.</p>
